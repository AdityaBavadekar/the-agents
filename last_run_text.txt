│ The cut-off for computer science in COEP varies every year, depending on the number of students who apply and │
│ the difficulty of the exam. In 2021, the cut-off for computer science was 183.5 out of 200 for the general    │
│ category. However, it is important to note that the cut-off can vary significantly from year to year.         │
│ Therefore, it is always advisable to aim for a higher score in order to get into COEP.                        │
│                                                                                                               │
│ Here are some tips for getting into COEP:                                                                     │

│  • Start preparing for the CET early. There are many online resources and coaching classes that can help you  │
│    prepare for the exam.                                                                                      │
│  • Make sure you understand the syllabus and the marking scheme of the exam.                                  │
│  • Practice solving past year papers to get a feel for the type of questions that are asked in the exam.      │
│  • Stay calm and focused on the day of the exam.                                                              │
│  • Don't leave any questions unanswered.                                                                      │
│  • If you are not sure about the answer to a question, make an educated guess.                                │
│  • Don't spend too much time on any one question.                                                             │
│  • Review your answers carefully before submitting your paper.                                                │
│                                                                                                               │

│ Sure. There are 167 days remaining for the CET exam. To calculate this, we can subtract the date of today     │
│ from the date of the CET exam.                                                                                │

│ 31 October 2023 - 18 April 2024 = 167 days                                                                    │

│  • Be realistic about how much time you have to study. Don't try to cram too much into your schedule, or      │
│    you'll just end up feeling stressed and overwhelmed.                                                       │
│  • Start with a blank slate and map out your priorities. What subjects do you need to focus on the most? How  │
│    much time do you need to spend on each subject?                                                            │
│  • Be flexible. Things will come up that you didn't plan for, so be prepared to adjust your timetable as      │
│    needed.                                                                                                    │
│  • Take breaks. It's important to take breaks when you're studying, otherwise you'll just end up getting      │
│    burned out. Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes, and take a longer break every hour or so.          │
│  • Reward yourself. When you reach a goal, give yourself a small reward. This will help you stay motivated    │
│    and on track.                                                                                              │

│ This is just a sample timetable and you may need to adjust it to fit your own schedule and needs. For         │

│ The important thing is to create a timetable that works for you and that you can stick to.                    │
│                                                                                                               │
│ Here are a few tips for creating a successful study timetable:                                                │

│  • Be realistic about how much time you have to study. Don't try to cram too much into your schedule, or      │
│    you'll just end up feeling stressed and overwhelmed.                                                       │
│  • Start with a blank slate and map out your priorities. What subjects do you need to focus on the most? How  │
│    much time do you need to spend on each subject?                                                            │
│  • Be flexible. Things will come up that you didn't plan for, so be prepared to adjust your timetable as      │
│    needed.                                                                                                    │
│  • Take breaks. It's important to take breaks when you're studying, otherwise you'll just end up getting      │
│    burned out. Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes, and take a longer break every hour or so.          │
│  • Reward yourself. When you reach a goal, give yourself a small reward. This will help you stay motivated    │
│    and on track.                                                                                              │
